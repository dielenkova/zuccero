<h6>MISSION</h6>
<p>TO INSPIRE AND PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY, SUSTAINABLY MADE, ALLERGY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS THAT SERVICE BOTH OUR CUSTOMER AS WELL AS OUR ENVIRONMENT, THE SMALL WORKING FARMER AND ECOLOGICAL HABITATS. </p>
<p>Wholesome Bakery was founded by Mandy Harper in 2009 with the belief that you should be able to eat great tasting goodies without it weighing on your conscience. That you should be left feeling proud and excited with the company you're supporting. After countless hours of work, Wholesome Bakery is proud to serve up an array of super-yummy goodies baked with thoughtfully sourced, locally produced, organic ingredients. Our sweet treats aren't only healthy for you, they're healthy for Mother Earth! Please enjoy! </p>

<p>Mandy Harper - Founder & CEO</p>
<p>Mandy always had an interest in nutrition and sustainability. Becoming a vegetarian at 11, then vegan at 13, Mandy spent more than half her life on the lookout for high quality products that fit her dietary restrictions and allergies. With a big sweet tooth and little to choose from, Mandy decided to take on the task of creating guilt-free goodies! It all started with a signature carrot cake that she made for friends and family. After hearing rave reviews, she thought she might be onto something. Continuing to make new recipes for cookies and cakes, she was encouraged by her growing number of fans to sell them. So she gathered up all of her gusto and dropped off samples at two local grocery stores. Now Wholesome Bakery has products all over the Bay Area and is continuing to grow!</p>

<p>With Mandy, are Sabrina Carreno the Bakery Director and Anna Schoenberger the Operations Manager.</p>
<p>We have the best fans and supporters around! Many have gone out of their way to let us know how much they love what we are doing at Wholesome Bakery. This is our small thank you to them for how much their kind words meant.</p>
